### About me

At the moment I work as an engineer. At my work we have waterflow development processes. My main responsibilities are: assembly, installing software and testing. About a year ago I started to learn programming on my own. My introduction began with Java, but later I switched to C #, this direction seems more promising. Most recently, I finished the C # Developer course at the Educational Center of High-Tech Park. To start in IT, I lack the experience and knowledge that I can get after taking this course.

### Interests

My personal interests include:  
Electronics. Interested in a variety of electronic device, also do their repairs in the best of their ability.  
Beekeeping. My grandfather kept the apiary in my family. In childhood, I went with my father to help him and learned a lot of new things. Today, we continue his work.  
Active rest. I like walks in the park, ride a bike, relaxing into the outdoors.
